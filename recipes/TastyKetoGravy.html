    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Leftover Grease from cooking protein preferably a juicy steak</li>
        <li>3-4 Tbs Grassfed Butter</li>
        <li>Beef Bone Broth</li>
        <li>Startch i.e. Coconut flour or Xanthum Gum</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Cook your protein of choice over a pan with 1-2 tbsp of Grassfed butter and season to your taste. I like to use cast Iron for this.</li>
        <li>2. After it's finished remove protein item from the pan leaving as much of the grease or remnants on the pan as possible</li>
        <li>3. Next, bring the pan to low-med head and add the reamining amount of butter and slowly mix in some bone broth</li>
        <li>4. Stir gently and slowly add in some of your starch of choice</li>
        <li>5. Finally, once everything starts to thicken up nicely and you can scrape a spatula along the bottom and nothing sticks to the pan you are done. Place into a little gravy or sauce bowl and serve :)</li>
    </ol>
